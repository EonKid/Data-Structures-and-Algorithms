"""
Two players take turns at choosing one coin eachâ€”they can only choose from the two coins at the ends of the line.
 The game ends when all the coins have been picked up. The player whose coins have the higher total value wins.
  A player cannot pass his turn.

Design an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum total value for the starting
player in the pick-up-coins game.
